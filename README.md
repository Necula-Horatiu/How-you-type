# How-you-type

An application that can log you based on how you type.
For that I used an API made by https://www.typingdna.com/

#How to use it

First you need an acount on they website. There you will find an apiKey and an apiSecret.
Use them in Controllers/mainController.cs

After that, when you open the project you will have to make an account. Once you have an account type your username again and the text bellow and see if you are the real you!
